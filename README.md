# Open-Data-Project-

My not-so-spectacular plan

STEP 1: 

clean up the excel data, leaving only the important bits
import them all onto jupyter
Sort things arounds and play with the values

STEP 2:

decide what to do with over 2300 dataset from stations measuring water quality. 
    - eutrophication 
    - drinking water
    - safety of recreational waterspace
    - potentioal hazardous microbe
    
    
    
Step 3: 

RESEARCH THE FUCK OUT OF CHOSEN TOPIC
send for peer review (needs to be done AT LEAST 4 weeks before it is due)
send for professors citation


GOALS:
- become proficient at manipulating data in jupyter
- become proficient at using git hub/stack overflow 
- become proficient in python
